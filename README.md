The following project started as I wanted to answer the following questions using data.

Is climate change real, what is actually happening?
Is there countries or regions that are disproportionally affected? What countries had the highest temperature increase?
Is the northern hemisphere changing differently to the southern hemisphere? 
Is there a specific rate of heating and is it accelerating? Can we forecast future rates of heating?
What is the mean temperature change across years? Can we forecast the mean temperature change for future years?
